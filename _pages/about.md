I am a research scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory [RAL](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/stfc/facilities/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/), working at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, (Didcot, UK).

My work lies at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the theory of optimization and inverse problems with applications in science and engineering.
